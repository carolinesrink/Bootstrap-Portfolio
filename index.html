                                My name is Caroline Rink and I was born and raised in Atlanta, GA. After my high school graduation in 2013, I attended the University of West Georgia for my undergraduate degree. I graduated in December of 2017 and moved back to Atlanta shortly after. I am currently a student at the Georgia Tech Coding Bootcamp to learn web development and computer programming.

                                I have two brothers, Christopher and David. David is a medical student at Emory University and Christopher is a software engineer in New York City. Christopher is the one who originally introduced me to computer programming last year.

                                My favorite hobby is traveling and I have been to seven countries so far. I participated in two study abroad program while I was completing my undergrad. The most memorable place I went to was my study abroad trip to Ireland. I also plan on visiting some Scandinavian countries this summer.
